Opposed to the FC NN, the performance of the CNN suffers if the images are shuffled. This makes sense since a CNN assumes by architecture that the ordering and local neighborhoods of the pixels matter (that is called a \"model bias\"): each neuron gets as input only a patch of neighboring pixels in the previous layer as input. The far-reaching correlations are learned by stacking more layers and hence increasing the perception field. Since a CNN has the \"model bias\" that neighborhood is essential, it does not have to learn that from scratch as a FC NN.
